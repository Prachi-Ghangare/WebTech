# History =>

    - Javascript was invented in year 1995 by Brenden Eich in Netscape.
    - Firstly the technology name was given as 'Mocha' -> 'Livescript' -> 'Javascript' inspired by Java.
    - It was developed to be used on 'Mosaic' browser.
    - Recent version is ES7 [ECMA(European computer manufacturing Association) Script].

# What is Javascript =>

    - Javascript is a Scripting programming language.
    - It is a high level , JIT complied and interpreted.
    - It is multiparadigm programming language (i.e. Imperative as well as Declarative.)
    - It has object oriented features.
    - It is rich in Functions.
    - It is dynamically typed PL.
    - It is Asynchronus(doesn't block at the time of execution)

    * Disadvantages over Java =>

    - JS is not secured.
    - It is not faster like Java.
    - It doesn't provide support for multithreading.
    - Also doesn't provide support for any I/O operations.

# Tokens =>
    It is the smallest part of JS PL.
    
    There are 6 types of Tokens
    1. Keywords
    2. Identifier
    3. Operator
    4. Seperator
    5. Commments
    6. Literals

* Keywords -
    Reserved words, aware by compiler, 51+ Keywords in JS, should be in lower case.

* Identifier -
    This are the name given by a programmer to the components such as class,variable, function.

    Rules :
        - cannot start with number
        - character spaces are not allowed.
        - only two special characters can be used i.e. "$" ,"_".
        - cannot use keywords inplace of Identifier

    Conventions - 
        1. Class - 
            Single word - 1st char must be in Uppercase
            Multiple words - Every words 1st char must be in Uppercase
            Pascalcase.

        2. Variable & Method - 
            single word - all char must be in lower case 
            multiple word - 1st word lower case 2nd word onward every 1st char must be in upper case 
            CamelCase.

* Seperator - 
    This are the character that are used to seperate block, statement, expression.
    Ex - {} , ; . () [] 

* Comments -
    - statements not executed by compiler and interpreter. 
    - This is used to explain logical part of code.
    - used to make run readable by adding details

    3 Types of comments - 
        1. Single line comment : "//"
        2. Multi line comment : "/*....*/"
        3. Documentation comment : "/**.. *.. *.. ..**/" 

* Literals- 
    nothing but data 
    - two types:
        1. Primitive
        2. Non-Primitive 

    1. Primitive - 
            number, boolean,string,null,undefined

    2.Non-Primitve -
            classes, arrays, object, etc.

* Operator - 
    - This are the special symbol used to perform some operation on operand.
    - operand can be variable, expression, literals.

    - Operators are classified based on -
        1. Number of operand
        2. operations they perform

    1. Number of operand :
        1.1 Unary
        1.2 Binary
        1.3 Ternary

    2. Operations :
        2.1 Arithmetic - [ + , - , * , / , % , ** ]
        2.2 Relational - [ < , > , <= , >= , != , == , === , !== ]
        2.3 Conditional -[ op1(condition)?op2:op3 ]  
        2.4 Assignment - [ = ] 
        2.5 Compound Assignment - [ += , -= , *= , /= , %= ]
        2.6 Logical - [ && , || , ! ]
        2.7 Increment & Decrement - [ ++ , -- ]
        2.9 Bitwise - [ & , | , << , >> , < , > , ^ , ! ] 
        2.8 Miscellaneous - [ new , typeof(), . ]
